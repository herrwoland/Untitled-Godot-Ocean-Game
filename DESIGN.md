# DESIGN — Untitled Ocean Delivery Game

A first-person, melancholic delivery game across five days on a hostile, indifferent sea.
You are a small creature surviving a huge land. Every day the world gets stranger.

Tone references: *Dredge*, *No One Lives Under the Lighthouse*, Arnold Böcklin — *Isle of the Dead*.

---

## 1. Core Loop (one in-game day)

1. **Wake up** in the shack. A letter has been thrown in from the mailbox slot.
2. **Read the letter** — it contains the pickup coordinates. The paper is carried with you and can be re-read any time (diegetic — no HUD).
3. **Walk the beach** to the ship. Board, take the helm.
4. **Sail** to the pickup coordinates. The brass device on the ship shows current coordinates, live.
5. **Dive** — packages are always underwater. Retrieve the package.
6. **Inspect the package** — the delivery coordinates are written on it. Re-inspect any time.
7. **Sail** to the delivery coordinates and hand off the package.
8. **Sail home**, walk to the shack, **sleep**. The game saves ONLY here. Next day begins.

You cannot sleep if the mission is unfinished.

## 2. Structure — Five Days

Each day is a `DayConfig` resource (data, not code):
pickup coords, delivery text/coords on the package, letter text, strangeness swaps to fire,
optional special scene, optional scripted cutscene triggers.

| Day | Beats (draft — tune freely) |
|-----|------------------------------|
| 1 | Clean run. Teaches the loop by shape alone. Calm-ish sea. |
| 2 | Scripted unrepeatable scare: something enormous passes under the ship — silhouette only, never again. First mild strangeness on waking (small props wrong). |
| 3 | First big swap visible on waking (e.g. lighthouse changed). Device digits flicker/drift briefly during sailing. Hunters more aggressive. |
| 4 | **Isle of the Dead** day: island resembling Böcklin's painting; deep well at its center; giant eel circling inside (Mario 64 homage). Package at the bottom of the well. |
| 5 | The letter breaks the pattern: delivery coordinates are **your own shack**. When you arrive, a fish hovers on the shore in front of the house. Climbing onto its back triggers the ending cutscene: the fish flies you to the moon. The game ends. |

Strangeness fires at transitions (wake up, return from a trip) — transformations are never witnessed, only discovered. Examples: ship→fish, shack→fish, giant lighthouse altered. Prefer few devastating swaps over many mild ones.

## 3. World

- Sandy shore with the shack; the only walkable land. Surrounded by a stony beach walled off by 20–30 m natural stone walls. One way to go.
- An absolutely huge lighthouse near the house on the rocks; its light sweeps far into the distance.
- Endless ocean, no other shores. Stormy, thick black clouds.
- Giant swimming creatures; some hunt you when you dive too deep.
- Giant ships on the far horizon, unreachable (candidate delivery framing / set dressing).
- Big feeling of melancholia. The world is hostile but indifferent.

## 4. Mechanics

### Navigation — coordinates only
- Ship device (brass instrument) shows live coordinates via `CoordinateSystem` (world XZ → displayed numbers, offset/scaled to read like an instrument, not engine units).
- Letter shows pickup coords; the package shows delivery coords. No map, no markers, no HUD.
- Later days: device digits occasionally flicker to wrong values (madness, cheap + effective).

### Diving, oxygen, death
- No oxygen meter: screen desaturation + vignette + heartbeat audio + existing underwater low-pass filter escalate as air runs out.
- Danger is depth-based and readable by darkness: hunters aggro below a depth threshold.
- **Death (drowning or eaten): you wake panting in your bed, same day restarts** (packages reset). No fail screen. The game never sends you back further than the current morning.

### The amulet (sonar echo)
Underwater you can barely see. A magical amulet the player finds lets them send an echo (V,
underwater only): for a moment everything within 300 m shows as a grainy pale echo, then it
crumbles back into the murk. **The echo itself is done** (`SonarPulse`, dials in GameSettings →
Sonar pulse); the amulet around it is next. Plan (agreed 2026-10-01, build once the model exists):
- **Found, not given:** the echo only works once the amulet is picked up (where/when — decide; a
  `has_amulet` flag in GameState, so it survives the death→morning loop and saves on sleep).
- **On cooldown:** the amulet rises from the player's neck into the bottom of the view, dull, not
  glowing. It shows how long is left — e.g. a pale light slowly filling it, or runes/facets lighting
  one by one, or the glow creeping back from its edge. Pick to suit the model. No HUD numbers.
- **Ready + pressed:** it glows pale blue as the echo goes out (emission + a small pale-blue OmniLight3D
  on it, so it lights the hands and nearby water), then dims as the cooldown starts.
- When ready and idle it rests on the chest, out of view (maybe a faint pulse in it when it's
  ready again — a sound or a glimmer at the screen's edge).
- Code side: an `Amulet` node on the player camera driven by `SonarPulse.cooldown_left()` and
  `EventBus.sonar_pulsed`; the raise/lower like the carry sockets. Ideas still open: the pulse
  attracting the hunter fish, and echo-only apparitions (shapes that show in the echo but aren't there).

### Item inspection (letter, paper, package)
Standard "hold-to-inspect" pattern (Resident Evil / Gone Home style):
- Interact picks the item into an **inspect state**: player input frozen, item lerps to a socket ~0.5 m in front of the camera, slight DOF/dim on the world behind.
- Mouse drag rotates the item; scroll zooms; E/Esc puts it away.
- Implemented as a small `Inspectable` component + one `InspectionController` on the player camera. Text on items is actual texture/mesh text readable up close (works at 640×480 — test font size on the package early).

### Cutscenes
- Small scripted moments at trigger points (Area3D or mission-phase signals), plus the day-5 ending (fish flight to the moon).
- Implementation: `CutscenePlayer` autoload wrapping AnimationPlayer + a dedicated Camera3D; cutscenes defined per-scene, triggered via EventBus. Skippable? — decide later (suggest: no, they're short).

### Saving
- Save ONLY on sleep: `user://save.cfg` — day number + settings (settings already persist separately).
- Death reload = re-enter the saved morning state.

### Ship
- Stairs/ladders on both sides of the hull (part of ship model or separate): Area3D + interact while swimming lerps you onto the deck. Same pattern as helm enter/exit.

### The kraken (guardian of a rock)
A giant, very old octopus (~66 m) wrapped round a rock column (`kraken_lair.tscn`: Column, Perch
marker, GuardArea, Kraken). Code: `kraken.gd` (behaviour) + `kraken_arm.gd` (procedural arms).
- **Idle:** arms wound round the rock (the rock's real shape is measured with rays once, so any rock
  works), creeping slowly, a couple of arms restless, the mantle breathing. Never fully still.
- **Wakes** when the player enters the GuardArea (any shapes the user sizes), swimming or sailing.
  Slow and huge: jet strokes (arms open slowly, snap shut), gradual turns.
- **Swimming player:** one arm reaches, two more follow a few seconds apart. Caught = coiled, swung
  about, dragged down; the arms never kill — the breath does. Mashing jump/swim_up (Space) loosens
  the grip; harder for each arm holding (1 arm ≈ 3.5 s at 8 presses/s, 2 barely, 3 never).
- **Player aboard a ship:** it takes the ship. Rises beneath her (its one fast burst), grips the hull
  (first grip drags her to a stop), shakes her ~12 s, rolls her over (player thrown off, one arm goes
  for them), drags her down and home and keeps her. Fighting free of that one arm = left alone.
- **Arms** move like real octopus arms: stiff long base, curling tip (per-joint bend limits rising toward
  the tip), always smooth curves, eased and slow (joint 18 deg/s, tip 14 m/s caps). A reach is a bend
  travelling base to tip. A caught player rides in the tip's coil; it loosens as they struggle.
- **Looks at its catch:** once it holds the player it slowly turns its head until they hang in front
  of its eyes (eye_center / gaze_direction on the Kraken match the model's eyes).
- **Grips the real ship:** it measures her visible meshes once and lays each arm up her side and over
  her rail. Optional exact spots: Marker3D nodes named `KrakenGrip*` on the ship (their height = hook).
- **Takes a giant fish over the player** (the lure): a giant fish in its waters comes first (it cuts its
  wake short for one). Too slow to chase it, it lashes and pounces; once an arm lands it coils four
  arms round the fish, drags it to its rock and feeds there, beak in the fish's flank, munching. The
  fish thrashes ~20 s, then is still. Fed, it ignores the player for the rest of the day. A player it
  already holds stays held, but fights free 4x more easily. Idle giant fish keep out of its waters;
  only a hunt (chasing the player) leads one in.
- **Gives up** when the player is 200 m from the perch; swims home and wraps round the rock again.
  Hunters stand down while it is awake. A new morning resets it and gives the ship back.
- Open: the kept ship strands the player at sea until they drown or the day resets — see §8.

## 5. Code Architecture

Existing foundation to build on: FFT ocean + `get_wave_height()`, buoyancy ship + helm piloting,
player walk/swim/pilot state machine, interactable pattern (Area3D + `interact()` + highlight),
settings/menus/theme, PS1 post-process, underwater audio filter.

New systems:

```
autoloads:
  GameState        current_day, phase, flags; save/load (sleep only)
  EventBus         signal hub: day_started, letter_read, package_picked_up,
                   package_delivered, returned_home, player_died, strangeness_triggered
  CutscenePlayer   plays scripted sequences, owns cutscene camera

resources:
  DayConfig        per-day data: coords, letter text, swaps, special scene, cutscenes
                   campaign = Array[DayConfig]

world systems:
  SanityDirector   listens for day_started / triggers; tells SwappableProps to swap
  SwappableProp    Array[PackedScene] variants (normal → strange → fish); swap(tier)
  CreatureDirector spawns/despawns ambient swimmers around player
  HunterBehavior   depth-triggered pursuit steering
  CoordinateSystem static helper: world XZ <-> display coords

player additions:
  InspectionController   hold-to-inspect state (freezes movement, rotates item)
  OxygenController       breath timer -> visual/audio escalation -> death signal

interactables (existing pattern):
  Bed (sleep/save gate), Letter, Paper, Package, ShipLadder, HelmInteractable (done)
```

Mission phase enum: `WAKE → HAS_LETTER → PICKED_UP → DELIVERED → CAN_SLEEP`.
Everything reacts to EventBus signals; nothing polls GameState.

Suggested script layout: `assets/scripts/core/`, `assets/scripts/world/`, `assets/scripts/player/`, `assets/scripts/interactables/` (migrate existing scripts opportunistically, not in one big move).

## 6. Build Milestones (each ends playable)

1. **Day-cycle skeleton** — GameState/EventBus, bed/sleep/save, letter with placeholder text, full phase loop with debug-box props.
2. **Mission objects** — inspection system (letter/paper/package), ship coords device, underwater package pickup, delivery point.
3. **World layout** — shore, rock walls, lighthouse placement, ship stairs, walk-only boundaries.
4. **Diving danger** — oxygen escalation, hunters, death→morning loop.
5. **Strangeness system** — SanityDirector + SwappableProps, day 2–3 content.
6. **Island day** — Isle of the Dead, the well, the eel.
7. **Tone & ending** — cutscenes (incl. fish-to-moon finale), storm audio pass, day 5, credits.

## 7. Asset List (user-made models)

Already have: ship, lighthouse, multiple giant fish.

Needed next (milestones 1–3):
- Shack: exterior + simple interior (bed, door, table, mailbox/letter slot)
- Letter + coordinate paper (readable text at close range)
- Package: waterproof bundle/crate, delivery coords written on it (readable when inspected)
- Ship coordinate device (brass instrument, readable numbers)
- Ship stairs/ladders (both sides) if not part of ship model
- Rock wall modules (20–30 m natural stone) for coast boundary
- Delivery marker (bell buoy or basket-on-rope from a giant ship)

Later (milestones 4–7):
- Hunter creature variant(s) — may reuse giant fish
- Isle of the Dead island, well interior, giant eel
- Strangeness variants: ship-fish, shack-fish, altered lighthouse (+ small prop swaps)
- The hovering shore fish (ending) + moon flight cutscene assets
- Distant giant ship silhouettes
- The amulet (sonar echo): hangs at the neck, rises into view on cooldown; needs an emissive
  part (or separate mesh) that can glow pale blue, and something that can show the cooldown filling
  (facets/runes as separate meshes, or a texture strip the shader can reveal)
- The kraken: ~50–80 m octopus, replacing `kraken/kraken_placeholder.glb`. Rig convention (the code
  finds bones by name): `body` root at the arm crown, `mantle` child (scaled to breathe), arm chains
  `arm_<a>_<k>` (a = arm 0.., k = joint from root, each bone's +Y down the arm, same count per arm).
  Mantle toward -Z, arms toward +Z, eyes up. Script that built the placeholder (and documents the
  rig): `kraken/source/build_kraken_placeholder.py`. Plus its rock column (with a collider, layer 1)
  and sounds: presence loop, wake, arm grab, grip breaking, hull creak.

## 8. Open Questions (decide when relevant)

- Delivery hand-off staging: buoy vs. basket-from-giant-ship vs. underwater chute (leaning basket — connects the distant ships to the player).
- Cutscene skippability (suggest no; keep them short).
- Whether day 4's eel is lethal or only a terror (suggest: lethal only if touched — Mario 64 rules).
- Wall-calendar or other diegetic day indicator in the shack (crossed-out days).
- Title.
- Kraken keeping the ship: the player is left at sea with no way home but drowning (or diving until
  the air runs out). Accept as a deliberate dead end, or have the morning come on its own after a while?
