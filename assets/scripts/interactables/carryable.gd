extends RigidBody3D
## A physical item the player can pick up, carry in front of the camera and
## drop anywhere (Amnesia-style). Reading happens by simply holding it close
## (Firewatch-style) — no inspection mode. Pairs with the player's
## CarryController; the one interaction rule lives there.
##
## While carried the body is frozen (kinematic) and its collision disabled,
## following the CarrySocket. Dropping restores physics and inherits the
## player's motion, so a letter left on the deck sails with the ship.
##
## Come to rest on a ship's deck, it is stowed: frozen and made part of the
## ship, so it rides her exactly through any surge, roll or turn and can never
## slide overboard. Picking it up takes it off the ship again.
##
## The package uses two extra behaviours (see exports): it is grabbed on touch
## (no aiming/E needed while diving) and it is neutrally buoyant — dropped in
## the water it hangs where it is instead of sinking away forever; dropped in
## air it falls until it meets the water and then holds there.

## Landed on a ship's deck (just above it, no longer falling onto it): become
## part of the ship. Only the vertical speed is judged: the deck pieces are
## carried along by the ship rather than moved by the physics, so the solver
## treats them as standing still and friction drags a landed item backwards
## across a deck under way -- waiting for it to settle would let it slide off.
##
## A falling item is set down by hand instead of left to the solver: the decks are
## moved by the ship, not by the physics, so a thin sheet landing on one (or lying
## there as she heaves up into it) can be pushed out through the wrong side. When
## the deck is within this step's fall, it is laid flat onto it right away.
