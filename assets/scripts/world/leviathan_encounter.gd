extends Node3D
## Brings the Leviathan. At night, when the player comes into encounter_area (swimming or sailing),
## one encounter starts: the creature is made deep under the sea ahead of the ship and plays it out
## (leviathan.gd), then frees itself. One encounter per entry, never two at once, and not again
## before `cooldown` has passed. Costs nothing while no encounter is running.
##
## Night: there is no clock yet, night is a weather preset; it counts as night while the sun is
## dimmer than night_sun_energy (the night presets are 0.3 and 0.5, the dimmest day one 0.6).
