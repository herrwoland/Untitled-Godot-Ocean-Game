class_name LeviathanSplash extends Node3D
## The water a body the size of the Leviathan throws about. It reads the body's colliders every
## physics frame (track()) and finds, all along it, where each cross-section cuts the waterline
## and how fast each side of it is driving into the water there. Wherever a side pushes the sea
## aside at u m/s, the water climbs it and is flung off, up to about u^2 / 2g (what a film's
## whitewater solver keys on too: water that is suddenly accelerated). That one rule makes:
##  - the bow: the blunt head shoves the sea aside at its full speed (50 m/s: walls ~100 m high);
##  - surfacing: the waterline races outward round the head as it comes up, faster than it rises;
##  - turns and the tail beat: the side swinging into the water throws it;
##  - diving: the sea closes over the back and the meeting water is thrown up between;
## and while a part is newly out of the water, it pours off it in cascades.
## The sea itself answers too (water shapes, like a WaterDeformer): the open mouth swallows the water
## in front of it, so the sea is drawn down into it there, while either side of the opening it is
## piled up against the cheeks, about V^2 / 2g high at full tilt, and breaks where that is steep.
## As in film work, the water is built in stages (bulk sheets, then lumps, then drops and a mist
## that hangs on long after), the bigger the slower: it all flies under real gravity. Each
## stretch of the body also leaves a churned wake on the sea (WakeEmitters it moves itself).
