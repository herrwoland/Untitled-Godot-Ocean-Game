class_name Leviathan extends Node3D
## Something ancient and colossal, shaped like a basking shark, that swims half out of the sea with
## its mouth always open. It eats lit ships. LeviathanEncounter brings it: begin() places it deep
## below the surface (it never pops into view) and it plays out one encounter, then frees itself.
## Too big to turn on the spot, it always swims on a curve (tuned in
## backups/leviathan_replays/leviathan_tuning.html, which these defaults come from):
##
##  - RISE: swims up from the deep on a gentle drifting curve. Shortly before it breaks the surface
##    its call is heard (call_lead s ahead), then silence; it surfaces surface_distance_min..max off. Its
##    WaterDeformers swell, break and calm the sea.
##  - DRIFT: the ship is dark, it does not know she is there. Its curve was aimed at spawn to pass
##    dark_gap_min..max off her flank; it passes, then goes down (PASSED, DIVE).
##  - HUNT: the ship is lit: it curves in on her at chase_speed. If she gets inside the circle it
##    can turn, it swims straight out (RUNUP) until she is run_up_margin outside it, then turns in
##    again. Within lunge_distance its head swings round as tight as lunge_turn_radius and the sea
##    flows into its mouth (suction_*), faster than she can sail.
##  - COMMIT: lit inside judge_distance: it comes for her at hunt_speed. Cut the power now and it
##    is too late: it holds its course.
##  - MISS: the power was cut before judge_distance: it carries on past her, cut_gap off its
##    flank, and goes down dive_after_min..max m past her. Lights on again before it goes down: it
##    comes round for her (return_multiplier faster, return_judge_distance, return_turn_radius);
##    cut again in time and it passes return_gap off. A lit ship it missed is hunted again.
##  - DIVE: sinks away to despawn_depth and is gone.
## A lure (group "leviathan_lure") within lure_range draws it while the ship is dark.
## Swallowing: the ship touching its MouthZone (at the end of the throat) is caught there and
## carried with it from then on; nothing ever moves the player, who stays aboard her like on any
## moving deck. The player inside its MouthInside (the mouth cavity) for mouth_time s straight is
## lost: the view fades to black over fade_time s and they die (the same morning restages). Once it
## has caught the ship or the player is in its mouth it swims on slowly dive_delay_min..max s and
## goes down (SWALLOW, then DIVE). A ship it took down without the player is kept until morning.
##
## Body: the Head (mouth at the origin, the body toward +Z) is rigid; the Body's segments are laid
## along the path the head swam, so the long body bends through the curves behind it. A rigged model
## bends the same way: its spine (the bone chain from body_center down to the tail, bones named
## *obsolete* left alone) is turned to follow the path, with a slow tail beat on top. The scene is
## built at MODEL_LENGTH; body_length scales the whole creature.
