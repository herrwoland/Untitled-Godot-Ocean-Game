class_name PlayerBody extends Node3D
## The player's own body, only ever seen from inside it: look down and there are your legs, at the
## helm your hands are on the wheel, and the sun throws your whole shadow on the deck. Built from a
## rigged model and an animation library on the same rig (Quaternius' universal humanoid, CC0), so
## any clip in the library plays on it as it is, and a resculpted body keeps working as long as it
## keeps the rig.
##  - Its eyes are pinned to the camera, whatever the clip does (walking, swimming flat out, steering),
##    so the view is always from inside the head. It is scaled once so its eyes stand at the
##    camera's height, which also puts its feet on the ground.
##  - The head is cut out of the copy you see (from inside it would only block the view); a full copy
##    with the head casts the shadow and nothing else.
##  - It plays the clip for what the player is doing (see _pick()).
##  - It has a facing of its own: standing, the view can swing round some way before the feet follow,
##    the rest of the turn taken by the back and neck (see body_rig.gd); walking or swimming it turns
##    with the view; at the helm it faces the wheel with its hands on two spokes. Swimming under the
##    water it lies along the view, head first (see _swim_tilt()), so the strokes are out in front.
##  - Carrying something, its hands hold it at the item's grip markers (see _carry()).
##  - Under the water it is lit like it is that deep (see _depth_tint()), and swimming at the surface
##    its hands splash where they come down through the waves (see _hand_splashes()).

## Every .glb/.gltf in here is a set of clips on the body's rig. The standard library loads first, the
## rest after it by name, so a clip of the same name in a later file replaces the earlier one.
